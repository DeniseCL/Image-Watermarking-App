# PIL - Python Imaging Library
""" PIL (Python Imaging Library) is a library that provides extensive support for image formats, 
efficient internal representation, and powerful image processing capabilities.

However, PIL is now deprecated and no longer maintained. It has been succeeded by Pillow,
an actively maintained fork of PIL that is fully compatible with it.

Note: When you import Image, ImageDraw, and ImageFont from PIL, you are actually using Pillow.
You can install Pillow via: `pip install pillow`."""
